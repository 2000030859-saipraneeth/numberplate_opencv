To create a high tech box effect as seen in movies, you can add additional lines and shapes to the image. Here's an example modification to the code:

python
Copy code
import cv2
import numpy as np

img = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply a threshold to the image to get a binary image
ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Find the contours in the binary image
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Find the contour with the largest area
max_area = 0
largest_contour = None
for contour in contours:
    area = cv2.contourArea(contour)
    if area > max_area:
        max_area = area
        largest_contour = contour

# Approximate the contour to a polygon
epsilon = 0.01 * cv2.arcLength(largest_contour, True)
approx = cv2.approxPolyDP(largest_contour, epsilon, True)

# Draw the polygon on the image
res = img.copy()
cv2.drawContours(res, [approx], 0, (0, 255, 0), 3)

# Add additional lines and shapes for a high tech effect
height, width, _ = img.shape
center = (width // 2, height // 2)
cv2.line(res, center, tuple(approx[0][0]), (255, 0, 0), 3)
cv2.line(res, center, tuple(approx[1][0]), (0, 255, 255), 3)
cv2.line(res, center, tuple(approx[2][0]), (255, 255, 0), 3)
cv2.line(res, center, tuple(approx[3][0]), (0, 255, 0), 3)
cv2.circle(res, center, 50, (255, 0, 255), 3)

cv2.imshow('image', res)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
In this modified code, we first find the contour with the largest area in the image, then approximate it to a polygon. We draw the polygon on the image as before, but we also add additional lines and shapes to create a high tech effect.

Specifically, we add four lines from the center of the image to each of the four corners of the polygon, using different colors for each line. We also add a circle at the center of the image with a different color.

You can adjust the colors and positions of the lines and shapes to achieve the desired effect.
